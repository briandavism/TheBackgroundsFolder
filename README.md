# TheBackgroundsFolder
After years of lingering in obscurity some questioned whether the Backgrounds Folder still existed. Some wondered if it had ever existed at all or if it had been some shared nightmare. Little did they know that a small cabal of tortured souls toiled in secret feeding the beast and scouring the dark corners of the internet for forbidden treasures to heap upon the beasts mighty trove. Now it is unleashed! Bigger than anyone ever imagined it could grow. Do you dare pull the repository? Do you roll the dice? What unspeakable horror might be on your screen when your parents come to visit? Which difficult to explain image will your roommate see? Join us to find out. Also with Git you can now contribute new images to the folder if you are a collaborator so you don't need to email them to me any more.
